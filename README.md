# Usage

Install dependencies (Tailwind) from [Tailwind installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)

```
npm install
```

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the **input.css** during development. The output file is **css/main.css**

```
npm run watch
```

To build once run...

```
npm run build
```

You can edit the scripts in package.json and the tailwind.config.js file to change input/output locations
